			<p> This is my dog Gnar, he is a 7 year old chow chow/lab mix and he is one of the loves of my life</p>
			<p> I got Gnar when I graduated high school back in 2015 and he has been nothing but wonderful</p>
			<p> He gets his name from a video game that I have played for the past 9 years called League of Legends</p>

			<p> This is my other dog Ahri, she is a 3 year old great pyrenees/lab mix and she is the other love of my life</p>
			<p> I got Ahri when she was 6 months old so Gnar could have a friend to play with while I was in class or at work</p>
			<p> Ahri also gets her name from the same game that I play and she is just a bundle of energy and never seems to want to stop moving</p>
